# Golang REST API with mux :rocket:
---

#### An approach to building a REST api with Go with mux router.

A simple CRUD api filled with mock data using structs and no databases.

#### Instructions
* Do the usual git clone.
* Make sure you have go toolchain installed.
* install the [mux router](https://github.com/gorilla/mux).
```
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
```
* Run ``` Go run main.go ```
* open browser and go to ``` localhost:8000 ```
you should see a message *404 not found* it means the server is up and running.
* Play with the api using postman.
